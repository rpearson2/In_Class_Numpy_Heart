    "We found that there was weak correlation between our variables. The average age of the data set was 54 with the maximum age being 77 and the minimum age being 29. For this data, we found that it was better to use data filtering instead of correlation. Men made up more of the data set than females. The percentage of males that had high cholesterol was 82.6%, while the percentage of females that had high cholesterol was 85.4%. \n",
